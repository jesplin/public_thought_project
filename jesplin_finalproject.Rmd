## INITIAL DATA PROCESSING

# set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/jesse/OneDrive - UW-Madison/2020 Fall Semester/904 AP Field Seminar - Public Opinion/Final Project/ps904-project/public_thought_project")

# load data sets
lvn <- read.csv("data/LVN_data.csv")
tweets <- read.csv("data/tweets_data.csv")
blm3 <- read.csv("data/blm_03.csv")
blm4 <- read.csv("data/blm_04.csv")
blm5 <- read.csv("data/blm_05.csv")
blm6 <- read.csv("data/blm_06.csv")

# merge blm datasets by adding each onto the first as additional rows
talk_radio <- rbind(blm3, blm4, blm5, blm6)

# export combined data set to csv
write.csv(talk_radio, file = "data/talk_radio.csv")

# moved blm separate csv files into new folder: "data/talk_radio_separate"

## LOADING DATA GOING FORWARD

# set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/jesse/OneDrive - UW-Madison/2020 Fall Semester/904 AP Field Seminar - Public Opinion/Final Project/ps904-project/public_thought_project")

# load data sets
lvn <- read.csv("data/LVN_data.csv")
tweets <- read.csv("data/tweets_data.csv")

# load packages


# can I analyze the datasets separately or do I need to put them altogether?? Not sure how that would even work
