"Although I am not wise with words, i will say that I cannot fucking stand what is happening to our people of color in America, even globally. As said, all lives don‚Äôt matter until black lives matter. #BlackLivesMatter"
Kinda weird that when Black Lives Matter protestors tear down confederate monuments they‚Äôre labeled as rioters and thugs and not patriots tearing down the monuments dedicated to traitors
All lives do matter BUT RIGHT now the focus is BLACK LIVES because BLACK LIVES are the affected. If we can‚Äôt promote that BLACK LIVES matter then we will NEVER be able to say that ALL lives matter.
".@GrantNapearshow here‚Äôs a video of a man yelling ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter!‚Äù at a Black Lives Matter protest in SLC, while shooting arrows at innocent people. You can defend your intent all you want, but until you apologize for your ignorance, your intent doesn‚Äôt mean anything."
"it‚Äôs lowkey disrespectful how some of these influencers are posting a picture of themselves with a caption dedicated to the black lives matter movement then calling it a day, like okay good you‚Äôre raising awareness but post about the petitions, the names, etc..."

@Yatoneros @Crunchyroll how is speaking up and declaring that black lives matter push the narrative that‚Äôs it‚Äôs all for PR and Crunchyroll supports looting and rioting. make it make sense.
I wish I saw some big streamers explicitly saying BLACK LIVES MATTER. Or really ANYTHING definitive about the climate rn. Really makes me sad that the gaming community likes to dip their toe in social justice for fear of losing revenue.
"I need to tread carefully here, as I truly do want to affirm the need for police reform and the broader reform of our entire society which, at base, is irrefutably built upon codified white supremacy. Black Lives Matter is well worthy of support here. Full stop."
"people who post ‚Äúblack lives matter!‚Äù but on their PRIVATE stories are letting racism happen and just standing by and are the reason we are in recession. like, if ur not sharing it publicly, then, does it even matter?"
I literally just saw a Facebook post that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to go burn down the projects‚Äù like STFU!!!!! So many people who aren‚Äôt African American support Black Lives Matter and we will do anything to see change. I‚Äôm sorry that people are still like this.

@FabelaD @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump Black lives matter doesn't mean all lives don't matter. At this point and time people are trying to bring attention to the wrong doin against black people that has once again happened after being deeply rooted for more than 200+ years
This is the same reason people are rioting and protesting. YOU PERCIEVE US AS THREATS AND WE AREN'T. BLACK LIVES MATTER!!!! #BLACK_LIVES_MATTERS
@panversionofmj Now isn‚Äôt the time to say all lives matter. Yes all lives do matter but now we are focusing on black lives. Most creators only said black lives matter. This month showed that black people are treated differently so it is not appropriate to talk about other lives
"We stand in solidarity against racism and injustice because Black Lives Matter, in the US, in New Zealand, in Australia, everywhere. #BlackLivesMatter"
i will NEVER understand how someone can say ALL LIVES MATTER yet be opposed to BLACK LIVES MATTER. if all lives matter why are we having the problems that we are???
"There are tags out there with EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE combination of ""Black lives matter"" misspelling. This clearly shows us who are the ones supporting this shit #BlackLivesMatter #BlackLifesMatter #BlackLifesMatters #BlackLifeMater #BlackLivesMatters #BlackLivesMater"
@sarahcpr @MelanieSpell That Trump statement is very racist at the highest level . It's like like black people are special needs people  that one  has to reaffirm their love for . It just doesn't sound right ! Can you imagine Obama saying black lives matter loves white people .

The way that univision and telemundo are portraying the protests and the black lives matter movement is so horrible. i am ashamed that these are my people. when it‚Äôs abolish ice black people were and still are standing with us...
"‚ÄúSaying ‚ÄòAll Lives Matter‚Äô as a response to 'Black Lives Matter‚Äô is like saying the fire department should spray down all houses in a neighborhood even though only one house is on fire‚Ä¶because all houses matter. ¬†Yes, your house matters...‚Äù https://t.co/iErS4u70dh"
"""Black Lives Matter you Faggot.""  Some people are absolutely despicable. How could someone preach so much love and hate in one sentence I am almost impressed."
@emoth0tposting @Shannyisme they‚Äôre only a ‚Äúterrorist group‚Äù because they‚Äôre standing up to trump and defending our black community! BLACK LIVES MATTER!
@marcelineFsteel @twchywitchygirl I want my friends to be able to walk around without fearing for their lives. I want my goddaughter to be able to identify with characters in movies and tv shows. I want every POC on this horror-filled planet to be safe in their own skin. No lives matter til black lives matter.

@MarkyHutt #GeorgeFloydProtests Americans ‚Äúfuck da police‚Äù ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù ‚Äújustice for floyd‚Äù hold on a second whilst I rob a load of shit... fuck sake USA you ever think sometimes that you can protest without violence or looting??
"Black Lives Matter, the non-violent protests are righteous, and Seattle‚Äôs curfew is bullshit. Went for an evening walk around Phinney Ridge (again, fuck that curfew) and many also out and about, though mostly seems to be neighbors. Almost no one wearing masks though."
"Lou been spouting off about black lives matter for a few days now, but let's never forget how he was more than willing to let JERMAIN taylor die or suffer brain damage by knowingly letting him fight with a brain bleed."
"So, they scream BLACK LIVES MATTER. I think ALL LIVES MATTER! But, THEY go and destroy the shops, burn cars, steal from homes and then wear T-shirts saying: BLACK LIVES MATTER! As they steal/loot and destroy‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WsZ6pkJGOt"
Terrorizing common people in the name of Black Lives Matter. This will end. It will end. They have done nothing but discredit the movement for freedom.
"My heart genuinely hurts seeing how protestors are being mistreated for a right this country brags about so much, THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY W FREEDOM OF SPEECH, HEAR US OUT !   BLACK LIVES MATTER !"
"anyway, it‚Äôs June!   üåª your Mental health matters ‚ùå Junk TERROR Bill  üíõ Black Lives Matter every day ‚Äî and please don‚Äôt send tweet of ‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù ‚ÄºÔ∏èMASS TESTING PH   üó£OUST DUTERTE ‚ú®Renew ABSCBN Franchise"
"@PostTweetism @YannickStromei @sahouraxo It's organised by several groups, including black lives matter. Same tactics being used to create anger and resentment, violence and looting to come. There are groups on twitter openly talking about this. Scary times"
"Weird Screen just appeared on Comcast, Paramount Station, flashed a message, black screen white lettering.  It said something like, ""We support Black Lives Matters....."" and it had the hashtag for BLM.  It was like the station was taken over for about 15 seconds or so, then gone."
@Redfishspot1 @MommaB3r1 @BioRecTech @AdamParkhomenko We‚Äôre you living in some other country when he was VP?  There was tons of violence!!! That‚Äôs when ‚ÄúBlack lives matter ‚Äú started. Really???
"people can‚Äôt say that Black Lives Matter isn‚Äôt a valid movement. especially since we have FUCKING ANONYMOUS ON OUR SIDE. game over, white supremacists üòå‚ú®üíû @YourAnonNews i love you"
Racism bad donal trump orange say his name (let me google it really quickly to make sure‚Äîokay cool) police brutality is real not because I experience it but because twitter tells me so black lives matter justice equality peace and love can have clout pls
"If my 80 year old dad can lay on the ground for nine minutes protesting the murder of George Floyd, you can come out tomorrow at the UC at 4 to show that black lives matter."
"@nia_ghtmare @breakurfall if you are continuing to support people that aren't using their platform to it's full potential, you're ignorant &amp; apart of the problem. also the ""aggresiveness"" is because many musicians/influencers have large audiences and promote music/branding rather black lives matter."
@xojrd @lilmissamaya @jesssikaaav Wrong. Whenever black people are the center of something there‚Äôs always people who take away from that and say ‚ÄúAND ALSO‚Äù. And it‚Äôs crazy how y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see a problem in that. The point is to come together and become allies FOR BLACK LIVES MATTER.
"trying to delegitimize the efforts of Black Lives Matter. And some incredibly brave people put themselves in harm's way to keep others safe. I know definitively that in Eugene, Black Lives Matter had nothing to do with the rioting and looting on Friday night, 2/"
we can't let that terrorist organization come to our city and burn it down that stupid to let them have it and then organized protest the hell is wrong with the policeBlack Lives Matter peaceful protest to take place in Redding on Tuesday https://t.co/EQaYvU7vDz
"For real seeing pyramid scheme girls out here on Instagram like ""Black Lives Matter!""  ""And that's why we carry this foundation in all skin tones! For just $19.95..."""
I got asked by a friend earlier if I think black lives matter!? Like what kind of a question is that yes black lives matter!! Better yet all lives MATTER!!!!   I have beliefs and if you don‚Äôt want me to go down that road then stfu!
"If you are offended by the phrase ""Black Lives Matter""   Please unfollow me. Simple as that.   Read the words again. Slowly.  Black. Lives. Matter. One of the most simple sentences i can think of. Don't dig deep. It means exactly what it says.   Unfollow me if it offends you."
"If all Black lives matter, what opportunities are you creating for Black artists, Black people? Which Black businesses are you supporting and promoting? Which Black orgs are you donating to? And for all of the above, are you also asking white people to join you in these efforts?"
"Black Lives Matter is being framed for violence in the same way groups like Patriot Prayer were framed. Most of the Black Lives Matters people I have spoken with, really care and respect the constitution. They want to fight against a tyrannical big government.  #GeorgeFloydMurder"
"@devon_hofmeyr ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre great‚Äù we get it, but you don‚Äôt have to kill us to be great. You don‚Äôt have to feel threatened from guilt about what you‚Äôve done to our people for years so much so that you resort to killing us for merely existing. That‚Äôs all black lives Matter is about. Let us breathe"
"https://t.co/aHnphDGb9O BLACK LIVES MATTER! #BlackLivesMatter  104 BLACK HUMAN BEINGS  who were UNARMED were killed by police in 2015 A tribute to them, this is more than George floyd! JUSTICE FOR ALL! https://t.co/0580camwzB"
"Back on here after being gone for the move (aside from a few retweets earlier today) and I want to just go on record as saying Black Lives Matter, this has not ever been and continues to not be okay, I am worried about my kids, and I support the folks out protesting. I will"
So you can go to Weverse or to FC to demand something to the boys but we can't spread links for donations for Black Lives Matter is bad? That's racist üòå
"I am truly sorry for not being able to support Black Lives Matter,i am a minor and i live in a different country, but i speak for everyone who wants but cant help, we do care and we are trying to do everything in our power to help #BlackLiveMatter #GeorgeFloydProtests"
"@mickjenkins Means nothing.  Most of them never mention the police, Floyd‚Äôs name or even say black lives matter.   They‚Äôre checking a box on a checklist to make sure they can‚Äôt get singled out."
"the whole situation rn looks like a film. but it's not. it's reality. i'm so tired of racism &amp; i can't find the right words, but i hope everyone will be safe soon. and remember, black lives matter, everyday. say their names. they all deserved better."
@BJinbias @KingMcQueen7 I didn‚Äôt really understand the riots but now I do not only black lives matter but to show that we are sick of the government lieing to us
@Shinybratty @AnythingforA @yungkiitten @PastelGirlfrien ‚Äújust racist because she‚Äôs white‚Äù ??? YOURE SHOUTING BLACK LIVES MATTER AT THE TOP OF YOUR FUCKING LUNGS BUT YOU BELIEVE WHITE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE RACISM???? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??? @anythingfora
"#blacklivesmatter I encourage you to please keep on spreading awareness about the issue right now. Everyone needs you voice to speak up! Everyone deserves to be respected, &amp; that same goes to them. If all lives matter, then black lives matter also. https://t.co/lseXuauoZT"
"@Janiepalace @NightmareHolic @7bels Saying ""all lives matter"" is a protest to the Black Lives Matter protest and no one should think it isnt, @JoynerLucas had that straight 2 years ago"
