@RepAdamSchiff Where were you and your democratic liberal friends along with black lives matter when a black police officer got gunned down in Oakland last night? That‚Äôs right it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative!! Why is it mostly blue states and cities rioting??

"friends with and shared personal stories with someone who thinks THAT of black folx, and of people of colour, i am so fucking disgusted and feel so betrayed.  this shit really weeds them out, huh.  BLACK LIVES MATTER. BLACK RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. PROTESTS ARE YOUR RIGHT."
@avilaaa__ They use his death as the opportunity to steal stuff for their selves very Selfish human beans They don‚Äôt care for their brothers and sisters but at the end of the day BLACK LIVES MATTER I‚Äôm so sick of America
"@koriyona @lilyisreallygay @aangbenders it absolutely is a symbol. and if you want a symbol so badly, then make one. if not, just voice your support and change your profile picture to the words ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù if you want a symbol. words can be a symbol, and they are."
"2 of the 3 women that started the Black Lives Matter movement are in the LGBT community. So this just makes you sound very stupid, but you still have time to delete this üôèüèæ"
"Es gracioso ver a los whitexicans apoyar el black lives matter, que no les encantaba denigrar a gente de piel de color? ü§î Keep that performative activism shit to yourself"
"Will people stop changing 'Black Lives Matter' to 'All Lives Matter.' It has never been in doubt that white lives matter, sadly this is not the case for black lives. From Slavery to the KKK to apartheid to racism we have behaved appalling. This must change. BLACK LIVES MATTER!"
"@tukpoki What happened in SoHo was robbery. Not protest. Not political. It was stupidity and robbery. I‚Äôm 100% for peaceful protests, and I am mixed. This is giving black lives matter a bad name."
"it‚Äôs 4am and i just watched a whole hour long tweet and delete fiasco of a youtuber struggling to get the very simple phrase ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù out and in conclusion celebrities aren‚Äôt going to save anyone, especially at this rate"
@Sanikkoo @Niobe71696557 @JL_Kdiamond This isn‚Äôt about just America  It‚Äôs in the name BLACK LIVES MATTER  This about black lives everywhere  Your country is not except Stop with the fake performative If you going to turn around and say their shit going around the world and the world doesn‚Äôt involve around you
@GeraldoRivera Black people have benefited longer than they have suffered and they continue to benefit Black lives matter is a word it is a form of brainwashing used by African-Americans to continue to get their own way in society  This is not racism this is a fact
@IronAvenger85 @EspySudea @hannahmrozak All lives matter was made to go against black lives matter... again you make assumptions that doesn‚Äôt correlate with anything at all. IT LITERALLY SAYS BLACK LIVES MATTER....
"üñã Support Shanna by signing ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù and I‚Äôll deliver a copy to your officials: https://t.co/TJj4hyzIIa  üì® Last delivered to @GovernorVA, Delegate Levine and Senator Ebbin  #VApol https://t.co/Wy8uUG7kHp"
"Instead of black lives matter or all lives matter, how about #NoLivesMatter and let‚Äôs just purge the earth of everything so that succession takes place and life in its entirety begins anew, starting all the way from molecules, to protocells, to lichens, to everything else"
"If ur sharing black lives matter posts for any reason other than u genuinely caring and wanting it to get better, then might as well not post."
"Yep, magazine is still on furlough for June. But we all have bigger concerns at the moment. Donate to NAACP to help support Black Lives Matter here: https://t.co/82zvT3hdMs"
"It isn‚Äôt that ONLY Black lives matter, it‚Äôs that Black lives matter TOO. That‚Äôs the entire premise of the campaign, for everything that Black people have suffered due to systemic racism and white supremacy. Countless Black people have been killed for the colour of their skin"
"@YorkshireJr @liamgallagher You've missed the point. You don't go to cancer fundraisers and shout ""THERE ARE OTHER DISEASES THAT MATTER TOO!"" Black lives matters isn't to say others don't. The same way cancer fundraisers don't imply other diseases are unimportant."
Anyone involved in activism will tell you it‚Äôs ‚Äòothers‚Äô who are the problem. Black Lives Matter? White kids graffitiing Starbucks. LGBT? Straight people making unreasonable demands &amp; creating backlash for the community. Watch for those with no skin in the game.
@TasselFox @jimmy320812512 @nyte_succubus @OakyDeer @Jerricalong_ If all lives mattered black people would not be protesting saying ‚Äúblack lives matter.‚Äù Let it marinate.
The very chaotic side of me really wants to be there in the protesting and chanting and fighting back. Yet I can only express that in words and I'm only leading a peaceful protest and support by just writing Black Lives Matter on my face and going around my small town.
"@CatMaterno @Nesitoss I remember seeing this, who posted it originally? Brics also could have a double meaning as actual bricks that was used by the black lives matters protesters to break into into stores,remember how all those piles of bricks just happened to be in the areas of protest convienantly?"
"@woolavy @liamgallagher All lives matter, yes, but right now the priority is black lives matter. Until black lives are valued by the masses there is no all lives matter. For all lives to matter people have to care and support everyone not just themselves"
@goodmorningngo @souvenirswift @authorisebeaver @1989outcharted @tayloreigns @PopCrave @Camila_Cabello @ShawnMendes don't protest black lives matter and contradict yourself https://t.co/3P32Ix128O
don't forget to show support to black people because BLACK LIVES MATTER and it's important to do everything we can to help them  #PrideMonth2020 #BlackLivesMatter
@draganslayer1 @Baligubadle1 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Two types of protests. Some protest because black lives matter while others protest ‚Äústay at home‚Äù for beers! https://t.co/NNj8r9Y0dV
Stonewall was RIOTS. I don‚Äôt wanna see a single person supporting Pride and not Black Lives Matter. Not to mention Stonewall was started by a black trans woman. Our causes are interlinked.

all lives can‚Äôt matter until black lives matter i don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so hard to comprehend about this. get it in your fucking head this is not about you.
"@BLMCaitthegoat @HITTHATSHlT @nfnrevealed bitch you dont even fucking know me, i been to the protest, i been donating money to people who lost their businesses to this bullshit, you put blm in your name and tried to start shit with white people. i was gonna be peaceful but fuck you  you aint for black lives matter"
Black lives matter. Brown lives matter. White lives matter. All life matters!   Dont get it twisted... &amp; dont lose sight of the reflection in the mirror.   You/we can be as ignorant as they want us to be.  Or you/we can be better‚úä
"@TheStarWarrior1 @netflix @Corey_WolfPack Saying black lives matter doesn‚Äôt take away the worth of all other lives, it‚Äôs just now in these times more than ever we need America &amp; the world to realize that black lives are HUMAN and should be treated as such. Should be listened to, and should be respected."
Hey pretty white bitch on fox.. don‚Äôt you dare cut someone off when they say ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù to say ‚Äúum all lives matter‚Äù WE KNOW! THATS NOT THE POINT! YOU DISMISSED THE WHOLE POINT THATS BEING SAID
lol given lana del rey‚Äôs slowness to react to the black lives matter movement it seems very ironic and self-gratuitous that she likened herself to norman rockwell
"i know i follow a lot of random brand across all my social media‚Äôs, so if any of yall know some that are outwardly supporting cops right/haven‚Äôt spoken up about the black lives matter movement PLEASE let me know!"
@cooldudettv @xs_warrior @alpha_jking @VictorMunarim @HAPPYHAHAJK @Banks Blm means that only black lives matter and alm means all lives matter
"‚Äúwhite lives matter‚Äù white lives have ALWAYS mattered and your white privilege is really REALLY showing, you wouldn‚Äôt be killed for the colour of your white skin.   This is about Black Lives Matter and if you can‚Äôt support that then stfu"

I think what‚Äôs most sad about having a parent as a cop right now is you aren‚Äôt allowed to have feelings about the Black Lives Matter movement. I can say I support it all I want but the moment I tell you I also feel for those involved in law enforcement it‚Äôs a problem...

@Decent_Banter @aprilwhitehouse The government eased restrictions and they are protesting that Black Lives Matter. What about all those on the beach at Dorset etc? The Government SHOULD NOT of eased up on Lockdown.
"@PeterSweden7 If all lives matter, them please help us fight for our cause.  We are saying Black Lives Matter in relation to injustice and systemic oppression"
@AnthonyKongphan What about the innocent white man that was just murdered for defending his store? Or the children‚Äôs hospital in dallas that is being trashed. With all ethnicities of babies? This is no longer about black lives matter. The cop who murdered floyd deserves punishment. Not riots.

It would be reprehensible for me not to utilise the platform and the privilege of what little avenues I DO have where people will listen to what I have to say.   Black Lives Matter. Protest. Use your platforms. Fight. Scream. USE YOUR PRIVILEGE
